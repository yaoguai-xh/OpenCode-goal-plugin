# Compatibility policy

## Supported package surface

The latest published release is the supported line. Public compatibility covers:

- the package root and `opencode-goal-plugin/server` ESM exports
- the declarations exported by `index.d.ts`
- the documented `GoalPluginOptions` fields
- the documented OpenCode hook names
- the six canonical goal tools and five legacy tool aliases
- persisted-state recovery from versions documented in the changelog
- concurrent persistence for distinct OpenCode sessions in one project, with
  single-writer protection retained per session and passive goal behavior for
  a same-session process that does not own the lease

The package requires Node.js 18 or newer and OpenCode 1.17.15 through the latest
compatible 1.x release. CI runs the complete unit suite on Node 18, 20, 22, and
24. Installed-package contracts compile TypeScript consumers using both NodeNext
and Bundler resolution and require a clean npm-tarball install to expose the
default agent-tool surface without a separately installed OpenCode helper package.

Filesystem-sensitive lifecycle tests run on Linux, macOS, and Windows. POSIX file
mode and symbolic-link protections are applied where the operating system supports
them; the plugin does not claim that Windows provides equivalent POSIX semantics.
The Windows job also runs the installed-package type, host, and tool contracts
so their portable npm launcher path is exercised in CI.

When two processes open the same OpenCode session, only the lease owner may read
or change that session's goal workflow. The contender keeps ordinary chat and
unrelated tools available, but goal controls are denied and ambient hooks do not
attempt a takeover. Canonical goal tools return the stable envelope code
`session_owned_elsewhere`; a `/goal` slash command instead produces a
human-readable denial through its normal model-rendered command turn. Once the
owner exits, an explicit goal command or tool may acquire the shard; recovered
active goals load paused and require an explicit resume. Forking creates a
distinct session shard and remains the supported way to work concurrently from
the same conversation.

The immutable-claim lease protocol atomically hard-links a complete regular-file
compatibility guard at `<shard>/state.json.lock`; active owners publish unique
claims in the sibling `<shard>/state.json.lock.claims-v2/` directory. Publication
is no-replace: an older lock directory and the current guard cannot both win the
same startup race. Older releases treat the future-dated guard as non-reclaimable,
while current releases determine ownership only from immutable claims. Automatic
takeover requires all participating processes to run the current release.
Legacy, incomplete, tampered, or unsupported lease layouts fail closed rather
than being rewritten online. If that condition persists, first close every
OpenCode process that could own the session and upgrade them; then either fork
the session or manually remove only the affected shard's adjacent `.lock` file
or legacy directory and `.lock.claims-v2` directory. Do not remove its state or
lifecycle ledger. The local filesystem must support regular-file hard links
and preserve the guard's future timestamp; the plugin does not fall back to a
weaker publication protocol.

## OpenCode host compatibility

OpenCode's experimental hooks and SDK request shapes may change within the 1.x
line. Automated tests cover both current flattened session inputs and the legacy
generated-client shape, but a real-host smoke test remains required when hook or
SDK behavior changes. The current manual provider matrix is maintained in
[providers.md](providers.md).

OpenCode custom commands still become model turns. The plugin handles `/goal`
arguments in `command.execute.before` and mutates the host-retained parts array
in place so the turn contains the plugin-generated command result rather than
raw command text. This makes command routing deterministic, but does not turn the
hook into a direct-render API: the selected model remains responsible for the
visible response.

For objective-bearing commands, retained file attachments may be expanded by
OpenCode into synthetic Read/MCP text and file parts before `chat.message`. The
plugin correlates that host-resolved shape to the exact one-shot command and
generated message/session before treating it as plugin-owned. Each retained
file must yield at least one resolved companion part; a host-reported read error
pauses the goal without reclassifying the command as human intervention.

OpenCode 1.17.15 and 1.18.10 do not invoke
`experimental.chat.system.transform`. Control-command correctness therefore
comes from the rewritten turn's escaped reporting frame, fail-closed tool
blocking, and parent-correlated lifecycle suppression. The system transform
remains registered as additional protection for hosts that support it.

## OpenCode 2

**Status: not supported, and not yet tested.**

The package declares `engines.opencode` and the `@opencode-ai/plugin` peer as
`>=1.17.15 <2`. That bound is deliberate: no claim in this repository is made
without a verified run behind it, and the project has not yet exercised the
plugin against an OpenCode 2 build. Treat OpenCode 2 as unverified rather than
as known-broken.

### What already exists in this direction

- `createOpenCodeSessionApi` speaks both the legacy generated-client shape
  (`{ path, body, query }`) and the flattened shape (`{ sessionID, ... }`),
  selected per operation and remembered after the first success. The
  `sdkShape: "flat"` option pins the flattened shape for embedded clients.
- Only read-only operations are ever replayed against the alternate shape, so a
  shape probe can never duplicate a mutating call. This invariant is pinned by
  the mutation contract.

### What a supported v2 claim would require

Before the pin is widened, all of the following need to pass against a real
OpenCode 2 build, not a mock:

1. Plugin load and hook registration through the v2 plugin entrypoint.
2. `command.execute.before`, `event`, `experimental.chat.system.transform`,
   `experimental.session.compacting`, and `experimental.compaction.autocontinue`
   firing with the shapes the plugin expects.
3. The execution-context signals (`chat.message`, `chat.params`,
   `session.updated`) still reporting the active agent, which the planning-only
   restriction depends on.
4. Session-API calls (`messages`, `promptAsync`, `create`, `get`, `update`,
   `abort`) under whichever argument shape v2 ships.
5. Goal-specific compaction context and recovery of running child sessions after
   a plugin restart, which are the areas most likely to differ.

### Configuration

The server entrypoint remains available from the root and
`opencode-goal-plugin/server`. OpenCode 1 also exports an optional
`opencode-goal-plugin/tui` entrypoint for the live Goal sidebar. The server
plugin and `command` configuration live in `opencode.json`; the sidebar entry
is registered separately in OpenCode 1's `tui.json`.

Plugins that *do* ship a TUI component are registered in a second file whose
location differs between OpenCode lines, and those formats must not be mixed.
The session-title [status indicator](../README.md#status-indicator) remains
available without the TUI entrypoint. The sidebar follows completed Goal tool
results from the current session and uses the server's project-local
per-session state files for restart and migration fallback; custom
`stateFilePath` or `OPENCODE_GOAL_STATE_PATH` values must be supplied to both
plugin entries.

## Versioning

Semantic-versioning intent is:

- patch: compatible fixes, documentation, and stronger verification
- minor: backward-compatible options, hooks, commands, or tools
- major: removal or incompatible change to a documented public surface

`testInternals` is exported for diagnostics and the project's own tests; it is not
part of the semantic-version compatibility guarantee.
